# Speaking Crops 

## Project Description
**Speaking Crops** is an **autonomous and remote** irrigation and water distribution system, capable of detecting leaks and collecting rainwater.
  - **Remote:** using a mesh network within the plantations and LoRa technologies for long-range communications, it is possible to use this system anywhere including locations without any internet connectivity;
  - **Autonomous:** based on very low consumption microcontrollers and renewable energies, this system is energetically self-sustainable. It is in charge of all water management, deciding where, when and how much to irrigate. This management and forecasting is done based on meteorological data received through the communication system.
  - **Leak detection:** ability to detect losses in the water distribution system, optimizing its consumption and enabling the verification of various types of system failures (especially useful in remote areas).
  - **Water collection:** the ability to collect rainwater so that it can be used later.
Speaking Crops is the technological solution that allows farmers to "hear" the needs of their crops in real time, and thus find the best strategy to reduce and optimize water consumption.
